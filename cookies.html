    <h1>COOKIE POLICY</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: October 18, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <p>This Cookie Policy explains how HASAN MAHER IBRAHIM AL-ZARRAQ (doing business as Hello Stranger) ("we," "us," and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies when you use our mobile application, Hello Stranger.</p>

    <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device. For the purpose of this policy, we will use the term "cookies" to also refer to similar technologies like `localStorage` that perform a similar function.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use a technology called `localStorage` for one essential purpose: to keep you logged in to your account.</p>
    
    <p>When you successfully sign in to the Hello Stranger app, we store a secure, anonymous token in your device's `localStorage`. This token allows the app to remember who you are, so you do not have to enter your password every time you open the app. This is considered an "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookie, as the app cannot function correctly without it.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party cookies for advertising, marketing, or non-essential analytics.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>Because the `localStorage` token we use is strictly necessary for the app to function and keep you logged in, there is no option to opt-out of its use other than by not using the app or by logging out of your account.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Cookie Policy, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:hellostranger.app01@gmail.com">hellostranger.app01@gmail.com</a></p>
